# Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Fouad and I am a front-end developer with a passion for designing and creating digital user experiences. Through my work, I strive to provide customers of all sizes with stylish and modern websites, web services, and online stores. In this project, you will find some examples of my work, including a weather dashboard, a day scheduler, and a password generator. I hope you enjoy exploring my projects and learning more about my skills and experience. Thank you for visiting!
